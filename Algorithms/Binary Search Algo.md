**Binary Search** is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of elements by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### âœ… Prerequisite:

- **The array must be sorted** (either ascending or descending).
### ðŸ§  Intuition:

- Pick the middle element.
    
- If it matches the target â†’ done.
    
- If the target is smaller â†’ search in the left half.
- If the target is greater â†’ search in the right half.
