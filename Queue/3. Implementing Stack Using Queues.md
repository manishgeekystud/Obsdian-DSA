# Stack using Queue

A Stack is a **Last In First Out(LIFO)** structure, i.e, the element that is added last in the stack is taken out first. Our goal is to implement a Stack using Queue for which will be using two queues and design them in such a way that **pop** operation is same as dequeue but the **push** operation will be a little complex and more expensive too.
