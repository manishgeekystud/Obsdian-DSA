A Stack is aÂ **Last In First Out(LIFO)**Â structure, i.e, the element that is added last in the stack is taken out first. Our goal is to implement a Stack using Queue for which will be using two queues and design them in such a way thatÂ **pop**Â operation is same as dequeue but theÂ **push**Â operation will be a little complex and more expensive too.

### ðŸ“Œ Inserting Data in Stack (using Queues)

- **Problem:**  
    Queue is **FIFO** (First In, First Out) but Stack is **LIFO** (Last In, First Out).  
    To make a **stack using queues**, we need to arrange elements so that the **latest pushed element** is always at the front of the queue.
    
- **Solution (using 2 Queues Q1 & Q2):**
    
    1. When `push(x)` is called:
        
        - Move all elements from **Q1 â†’ Q2**.
            
        - Add the new element `x` into **Q1**.
            
        - Move everything back from **Q2 â†’ Q1**.
            
    2. Now, the newest element (`x`) is at the **front** of Q1.
        
    3. So, when we do `pop()`, it will directly remove the latest pushed element â€” just like a stack!

ðŸ‘‰ In short:  
**Push operation rearranges the queue so that `pop()` always removes the last inserted element.**
