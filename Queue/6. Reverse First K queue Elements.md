### Reverse first K of a Queue

Difficulty: **Easy**Accuracy: **81.28%**Submissions: **159K+**Points: **2**

Given an integer **k** and a [queue](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/) of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first **k** elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

- enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue
- dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue
- size() : Returns number of elements in queue.
- front() : Finds front item.  
    

**Note:** The above operations represent the general processings. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.

"If the size of queue is smaller than the given k , then return the original queue."

**Examples:**

**Input:** q = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3  
**Output:** [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]  
**Explanation:** After reversing the first 3 elements from the given queue the resultant queue will be 3 2 1 4 5

**Input:** q = [4, 3, 2, 1], k = 4  
**Output:** [1, 2, 3, 4]   
**Explanation:** After reversing the first 4 elements from the given queue the resultant queue will be 1 2 3 4

## 🛠️ Approach (Stack + Temp Queue)

1. Use a **stack** to reverse the order of the first `k` elements.
    
    - Pop from queue → push into stack.
        
2. Use a **temporary queue** to store the remaining elements.
    
    - Keeps elements after `k` in correct order.
        
3. Push stack elements back into the original queue (reversed part).
    
4. Push temporary queue elements back (unchanged part).
