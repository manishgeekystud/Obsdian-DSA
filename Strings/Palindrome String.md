A string is said to be a palindrome if it is the same if we start reading it from left to right or right to left. So let us consider a string “**str”**, now the task is just to find out with its reverse string is the same as it is. 

**Example:**

**Input :** str = "abba" 
**Output:** Yes

**Input :** str = "geeks"
