The ****selection sort algorithm**** sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

- The subarray which is already sorted. 
- Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

### Approach:

> - Initialize minimum value(min_idx) to location 0
> - Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array
> - While traversing if any element smaller than ****min_idx**** is found then swap both the values.
> - Then, increment min_idx to point to next element
> - Repeat until array is sorted

Below is the implementation of the above approach:
```java
// Java program for implementation of Selection Sort
class SelectionSort
{
    void sort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;

        // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
            int min_idx = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
                    min_idx = j;

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first
            // element
            int temp = arr[min_idx];
            arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }
```
