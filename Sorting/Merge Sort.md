## 🔍 What is Merge Sort?

**Merge Sort** is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm that:

- Divides the array into two halves
    
- Recursively sorts them
    
- Merges the sorted halves
    

It is **stable**, **efficient**, and guarantees **O(n log n)** time complexity in all cases.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Steps

1. **Divide** the array into two halves.
    
2. **Recursively sort** both halves.
    
3. **Merge** the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
