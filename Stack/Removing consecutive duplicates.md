You are given string **s**. You need to remove the consecutive duplicates from the given string using a Stack.  

**Examples:**

**Input**: s = "aaaaaabaabccccccc"
**Output**: ababc
**Explanation**: The order is in the following way 6->a, 1->b, 2->a, 1->b, 7->c. So, only one element from each group will remain and rest all are removed. Therefore, final string will be:- ababc.

**Input**: s = "abbccbcd"
**Output**: abcbcd
**Explanation**: The order is in the following way 1->a, 2->b, 2->c, 1->b, 1->c, 1->d. So, only one element from each group will remain and rest all are removed. Therefore, final string will be:- abcbcd.
