# ðŸ”— Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists â€” Iterative Approach

---

## âœ… Problem Statement

Given two **sorted** singly linked lists `head1` and `head2`, merge them into a single sorted linked list in **ascending order**.

- The merged list should maintain **sorted order**.
- Return the **head** of the new linked list.
- The input lists are already sorted individually.

---

## ðŸ§  Intuition

Since both lists are sorted, we can merge them by:
- Traversing both lists in parallel
- Picking the **smaller node** at each step
- Moving that node to the result list

We continue until one list ends, and then append the remaining nodes of the other list.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Algorithm

1. Create two pointers: `head` and `tail` to track the result list.
2. Compare the first elements of `head1` and `head2`:
   - The smaller one becomes the **starting node** (`head`) of the merged list.
3. Loop through both lists until one becomes `null`:
   - Compare `head1.data` and `head2.data`
   - Append the smaller node to `tail.next` and move `tail`
4. After the loop:
   - Attach the non-null remaining list to `tail.next`
5. Return the `head` of the merged list.

```java
Node sortedMerge(Node head1, Node head2) {
    Node head = null;
    Node tail = null;

    // Step 1: Initialize the head of the merged list
    if (head1.data <= head2.data) {
        head = head1;
        tail = head1;
        head1 = head1.next;
    } else {
        head = head2;
        tail = head2;
        head2 = head2.next;
    }

    // Step 2: Traverse both lists and merge
    while (head1 != null && head2 != null) {
        if (head1.data <= head2.data) {
            tail.next = head1;   // Attach smaller node
            tail = head1;        // Move tail
            head1 = head1.next;  // Move input pointer
        } else {
            tail.next = head2;
            tail = head2;
            head2 = head2.next;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Attach remaining nodes
    if (head1 == null) {
        tail.next = head2;
    } else {
        tail.next = head1;
    }

    // Step 4: Return the new head
    return head;
}
