Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

- `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
- `listA` - The first linked list.
- `listB` - The second linked list.
- `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
- `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
- The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
- `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `0 <= skipA <= m`
- `0 <= skipB <= n`
- `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
- `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**SOLUTION**

## ✅ Your Approach (Length Difference Alignment)

### 💡 Logic:

1. Count lengths of both lists.
    
2. Skip the extra nodes in the longer list.
    
3. Move both pointers one-by-one until they meet.

**CODE**
```java
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    ListNode tempA = headA;
    ListNode tempB = headB;
    int l1 = 0, l2 = 0;

    // Step 1: Calculate the lengths of both lists
    while (tempA != null) {
        l1++;
        tempA = tempA.next;
    }

    while (tempB != null) {
        l2++;
        tempB = tempB.next;
    }

    // Step 2: Reset pointers to start
    tempA = headA;
    tempB = headB;

    // Step 3: Align both pointers by skipping extra nodes in longer list
    if (l1 > l2) {
        int skip = l1 - l2;
        while (skip-- > 0) {
            tempA = tempA.next;
        }
    } else {
        int skip = l2 - l1;
        while (skip-- > 0) {
            tempB = tempB.next;
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Traverse together to find the intersection node
    while (tempA != null && tempB != null) {
        if (tempA == tempB) {
            return tempA;  // ✅ Intersection found by reference
        }
        tempA = tempA.next;
        tempB = tempB.next;
    }

    return null;  // ❌ No intersection
}
