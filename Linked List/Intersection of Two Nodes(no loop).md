Given the heads of two singly linked-listsÂ `headA`Â andÂ `headB`, returnÂ _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, returnÂ `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at nodeÂ `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note**Â that the linked lists mustÂ **retain their original structure**Â after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to theÂ **judge**Â are given as follows (your program isÂ **not**Â given these inputs):

- `intersectVal`Â - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This isÂ `0`Â if there is no intersected node.
- `listA`Â - The first linked list.
- `listB`Â - The second linked list.
- `skipA`Â - The number of nodes to skip ahead inÂ `listA`Â (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
- `skipB`Â - The number of nodes to skip ahead inÂ `listB`Â (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads,Â `headA`Â andÂ `headB`Â to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will beÂ **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes ofÂ `listA`Â is in theÂ `m`.
- The number of nodes ofÂ `listB`Â is in theÂ `n`.
- `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `0 <= skipA <= m`
- `0 <= skipB <= n`
- `intersectVal`Â isÂ `0`Â ifÂ `listA`Â andÂ `listB`Â do not intersect.
- `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]`Â ifÂ `listA`Â andÂ `listB`Â intersect.

**SOLUTION**

## âœ… Approach 1 Two Pointer Switching

### ðŸ’¡ Idea:

- Start two pointers at heads of each list.
    
- When one reaches the end, switch it to the other list's head.
    
- They will either:
    
    - Meet at intersection
        
    - Or both reach `null` (no intersection
**code**

```java
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    ListNode a = headA;
    ListNode b = headB;

    while (a != b) {
        a = (a == null) ? headB : a.next;
        b = (b == null) ? headA : b.next;
    }

    return a; // Can be null or the intersection node
}

```
## âœ… Approach 2 (Length Difference Alignment)

### ðŸ’¡ Logic:

1. Count lengths of both lists.
    
2. Skip the extra nodes in the longer list.
    
3. Move both pointers one-by-one until they meet.

**CODE**
```java
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    // Initialize pointers and lengths
    ListNode tempA = headA, tempB = headB;
    int l1 = 0, l2 = 0;

    // Count lengths of both lists
    while (tempA != null || tempB != null) {
        // Count length of list A
        if (tempA != null) {
            l1++;
            tempA = tempA.next;
        }

        // Count length of list B
        if (tempB != null) {
            l2++;
            tempB = tempB.next;
        }
    }

    // Reset pointers to heads of both lists
    tempA = headA;
    tempB = headB;

    // If list A is longer, skip the extra nodes
    if (l1 > l2) {
        int skip = l1 - l2;
        while (skip > 0) {
            tempA = tempA.next;
            skip--;
        }
    }
    // If list B is longer, skip the extra nodes
    else {
        int skip = l2 - l1;
        while (skip > 0) {
            tempB = tempB.next;
            skip--;
        }
    }

    // Traverse both lists together and compare nodes
    while (tempA != null && tempB != null) {
        // If nodes are same by reference, intersection found
        if (tempA == tempB)
            return tempA;

        // Move both pointers forward
        tempA = tempA.next;
        tempB = tempB.next;
    }

    // If no intersection found, return null
    return null;
}

```
